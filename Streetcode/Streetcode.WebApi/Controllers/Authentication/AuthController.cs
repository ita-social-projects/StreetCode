🛠️ Refactor suggestion

Implement consistent security measures across the controller.

Consider applying these security measures controller-wide:

    CSRF protection for all state-changing operations
    Rate limiting for all public endpoints
    Consistent error handling and logging strategy

Example implementation:

 [ApiController]
+[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]  // Apply to all POST endpoints
+[EnableRateLimiting("api")] // Configure different limits per endpoint in Program.cs
 public class AuthController : BaseApiController
 {
+    private readonly ILogger<AuthController> _logger;
+
+    public AuthController(ILogger<AuthController> logger)
+    {
+        _logger = logger;
+    }
